# DBSCAN

You should prepare a brief presentation about **DBSCAN** for the next class. Please:

* discuss the theory behind each algorithm

* show its implementation in python using scikit-learn library

* show us the result of its execution on a simple dataset.

Please try to contact the folks in your group as soon as possible and notice us if you
will have trouble to reach out to them. We assume at least one person in each group has
some knowledge about the machine learning principals, but if it would turn out otherwise,
don't be afraid to contact us. Some scikit-learn and python information can be found in
the link below:

[Astrotech.io](http://python.astrotech.io/index.html)

and here is a source covering some machine learning principals:

[Stanford CS](https://see.stanford.edu/Course/CS229)

*(these sources are of course just some of the many more available on the web)*

As well as your short presentations, we will also have an introductory to Machine Learning
lecture next week, so don't worry if these concepts might seem challenging to some you
at the first glance.
